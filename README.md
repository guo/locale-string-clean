# locale-string-clean.js Usage

```
node locale_string-clean.js
```
to search all strings in code and *delete* nonexisting ones. This will also delete the strings that generated by code such as people name or partner descriptions.

To keep one string from deleting by this script, adding a ```.keep``` in the end of the string.

If you find the code does not comply with the above rule, you might want to just copy new strings to all other lang without deleting any. You can use this following script.

```
node locale-string-clean.js --no-delete
```
